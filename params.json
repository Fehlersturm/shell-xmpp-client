Most problems are related to command handling.  If you keep them sequential it should mostly work.\r\n\r\nYou need ncat or netcat for the connection, but no other external library. Most parsing is done with sed (and grep).\r\n\r\nI implemented this client/bot to remote control my openwrt router.\r\n\r\nshell-xmpp-client should work in bash and ash.\r\n\r\nIf you need another license (BSD, MIT,...) please contact me.\r\n","google":"UA-27155863-2","note":"Don't delete this file!

This is the successor of my code.google.com project: https://code.google.com/p/shell-xmpp-client/

I have imported the code.google.com versions as separate branches.


You need ncat or netcat for the connection, but no other external library. Most parsing is done with sed (and grep).

I implemented this client/bot to remote control my openwrt router.

shell-xmpp-client should work in bash and ash.

If you need another license (BSD, MIT,...) please contact me.
